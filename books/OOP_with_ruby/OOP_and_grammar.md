## Some fragmented thoughts with the relation between OOP and English Grammar

Coincidently I am learning OOP and English Grammar at the same time. We I was learning pronoun in Grammar, I just could not help thinking about the similarities between these two topics.

- object - noun
  - object has states and behavior
    - behavior(methods) - verb
    - states - adjective
- variables - pronoun
  - the meaning of pronouns can only be determined based on the current context, so as variables do
- subject - the caller
- verb - method
- object - arguments

If there is no pronoun in English, a sentence may looks like:

1 Mark loves this teapot so much, mark couldn't leave this teapot even one day.

But with pronoun:

2 Mark loves this teapot so much, he couldn't leave it even one day.

This way of expressing feels more natual and will not cuase ambiguity, but if we say:

3 He loves it so much, he couldn't leave it even one day.

Although we can't say this is grammatically wrong, but it provide few info about the main idea.

Comparing 1 and 2, it's so like that when the first time we use 'Mark' and 'teapot' we are likely intializing 2 objects, then assign them to two variables. Without initializing, variable make no sense, on the contrary, if we need to use same object multiple times, we don't have to intialize it every time before we use it, because we got variables.
